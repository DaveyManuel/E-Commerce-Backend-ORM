# E-Commerce-Backend-ORM

## Description

In this project, I was able to create a server based e-commerce backend that utilizes mySQL, Sequelize, express router, and dotenv. When a user initializes the start script the seeds will populate in their mySQL workbench, and when they type api/tags or whichever model they want to view, the json data will show on the page.

## Usage
 
To use, simply edit the .env file to your mySQL information and run the start script to populate the seeds. If you want to view the information as a parsed JSON object, type in the correct api route in your local host 3001. 

## UserStory

As a user, I want a backend that will seed product data based on its relationship to category, tags, and product tags so that the information will show in mySQL workbench when I run the start script.

## Motivation

The motivation for my project was to create a backend server that a front-end client could use in order to seed their data and view via their localhost and mySQL workbench.
